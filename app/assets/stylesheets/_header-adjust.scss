/* This is an local CSS adjustment to the header in the GOV UK template */

/*
	The template header grid split is
	1/3 for .header-global that contains the GOV.UK logo and crest
	1/2's for .header-proposition that contains the service name and sign out link if available

	The below code adjusts .header-global to arbitrary 20% with a min-width so that the logo doesn't break and .header-proposition to 80%
*/

/*
	If the name changes (shortens) or the template changes (unlikely), then this will need to be either removed or updated, preferrably removed.

	There is potential for this to be included in HMRC Assets Frontend with a modifier class so that it doesn't break any services using the template, but those with longer names can use the modifier class to adjust their header.
